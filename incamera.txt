IN CAMERA

SCENE 1

(Garcin, the Valet)
A Second Empire style sitting room.  A bronze statue is on the mantlepiece.

        GARCIN enters, looks around him.
So here we are.
        VALET   
Here we are 
        GARCIN  
This is how it is
        VALET
That's how it is
        GARCIN
I... I think that in the long run, one has to adapt oneself to the furniture.
        VALET
It depends on the people.
        GARCIN
Are all the rooms alike?
        VALET
That's right. It comes from the Chinese, the Hindus. What do you expect them to make of a second-empire-style armchair?
       GARCIN
And what do you expect me to make of it? Do you have any idea who I was? 
Whatever - it's of no consequence. After all, I was forever living amongst 
furniture I disliked, and in false situations*. And I loved it. A false 
situation* in a Louis-Philippe dining room - how does that sound to you?

 


        VALET
You'll see: in a second-empire salon, that's not bad either.

     GARCIN
Ha. Well. Well well well. (he looks around him) All the same,
I wouldn't have expected... You're not privy to what they're saying,
back there?

     VALET
What about?
     GARCIN
Well, you know... (with a large, vague gesture) About all this.
     VALET
How can you believe that nonsense? From people who've never set foot here. 
Because, in the end, if they had come...

     GARCIN
Yes.
                                        (they both laugh)





     GARCIN
The stakes, the grills, the leather funnels...
     VALET (looking at him)
You must be joking...?

     GARCIN
Oh? Oh right. No, I wasn't joking. (silence. He walks about) 
No mirrors, no windows, naturally. Nothing fragile. 
(with sudden violence:) And why's my toothbrush been confiscated?


     VALET
There you go. There's your human dignity coming back. Wonderful.

    GARCIN (violently hitting the armchair's armrest)
I'll thank you to spare me your over-familiarities. 
I'm not unaware of my situation, but I won't tolerate you... 

    VALET
There, there! I'm sorry. What would you have me do, all the clients ask 
me the same thing. They turn up: “Where are the stakes?” At that moment, 
I swear, they're not thinking about cleaning themselves up. And then, 
after they're reassured, there's there toothbrush. But, for the love of 
God, why don't you think it through? Because, finally, I ask you, why 
would you brush your teeth?

 


    GARCIN (calmed)
Well yes, in effect, why? (he looks around him) And why would one 
look at oneself in the mirror? As for the bronze, it has its time
 and place...
I imagine there are moments when I'd gaze at it with all my eyes. 
All of them, eh? But come, come, there's nothing to hide here: 
I tell you I'm not ignorant of my situation. 
D'you want me to tell you how this comes about? The bloke suffocates, 
he's plunged in, he drowns, only his gaze is above water, 
and what does he see? A Barbedienne bronze. What a nightmare! 
So come along. They've obviously forbidden you from answering me, 
I won't insist. But I'll have you know, you won't catch me unawares, 
don't come here thinking you've taken me by surprise: I take situations as 
they are. (he resumes his march) So, no toothbrush. No bed either. 
Because one never sleeps, of course?







    VALET
Ha*!
    GARCIN
I knew it. Why would one sleep? 
Slumber takes one from behind the ears. 
One feels ones eyes closing, but why 
sleep? One lies on a sofa, and 
pffft... sleep flies off! One must rub ones 
eyes, get up again, and everything begins anew.
    VALET
My, but how romantically you put it!
    GARCIN
Oh shut up. I won't cry out, I won't wail, 
but I will take the situation for what it is. I 
won't have it creep up on me 
without my having clocked it. Romantically? 
So it is the case that one doesn't actually have a need for sleep? 
# Distinction between dormir && sommeil?  #
Fine. Wait... Wait: why is that so 
painful? Why would that necessarily be painful? I 
see: it's life without breaks.
    VALET
What breaks?
    GARCIN (imitating him)
“What breaks?” (suspicious) Look 
at me: I knew it! There's what explains the 
grotesque and unbearable indiscretion of your gaze! 
My word, they've atrophied!
    VALET
What are you talking about?
    GARCIN
Your eyelids. Us, we blink. With our eyelids. A wink, that was called. A little black lightning, a curtain falling and rising: the break is made. The eye humidifies itself, the world is eclipsed. You have no idea how refreshing it was. Four thousand rests an hour. Four thousand little evasions. And when I say four thousand... So. I'm to live without eyelids? Don't play the fool. Without eyelids, without slumber, it's all the same thing. I'll no longer sleep... But how will I cope? Try to understand, make an effort: I'm a worrier, you see, and.... and I have the habit of worrying. But I... I can't worry without respite: back there I had nights. I slept. I slept deeply. By way of compensation. I had simple dreams: there was a prairie... A prairie, that's all. I dreamt that I was promenading about it. Is it daytime?

 

Valet

As you can see, the lights are on.

 

Garcin

Goodness. That's your day. And outside?

 

Valet (suddenly confused)

Outside?

 

Garcin

Outside! Beyond these doors?

 

Valet

There's a corridor.

 

Garcin

And at the end of the corridor?

 

Valet

There are other rooms, other corridors, stairs...

 

Garcin

And?

 

Valet

That's it.

 

Garcin

You get your days off. Where do you go?

 

Valet

To my uncle's, who's head valet, on the third floor.

 

Garcin

I should've know. Where's the lightswitch?

 

Valet

There isn't one.

 

Garcin

So? One can't turn them off?

 

Valet

The  management can cut the current. But I don't think they've ever done it on this floor. We've got electricity at our dicretion.

 

Garcin

Fine. So one must live with open eyes...

 

Valet (ironic)

Live...

 

Garcin

You're not going to pester me over vocabulary. Eyes open. Forever. It'll be day in my eyes. And my head. (pause) And if I threw the bronze at the electric lamp, would it turn off?

 

Valet

It's too heavy.

 

Garcin (takes the bronze in his hands and tries to lift it)

You're right. It's too heavy.

 

(silence)

 

Valet

Well, unless you need me, I'll be leaving you.

 

Garcin (suddenly surprised)

You're leaving? Goodbye. (the valet reaches the door) Wait. (the valet turns) Is that a bell, there? (the valet signs affirmation) I can ring and you'll have to come?

 

Valet

In principal, yes. But it's capricious. There's something stuck in the mechanism.

 

(Garcin goes to the bell and presses the button. It rings)

 

Garcin

It works!

 

Valet (surprised)

It works. (he rings it) But don't count on it, it won't last. So, at your service...

 

Garcin (gesturing for him to stay)

I...

 

Valet

Eh?

 

Garcin

No, nothing. (he goes to the chimney and takes the letter-opener) What's this?

 

Valet

You can tell: it's a letter-opener.

 

Garcin

Are there any books, here?

 

Valet

No.

 

Garcin

So what's it for? (the valet shrugs) Fine. As you were.

 

(the valet leaves)

Closing time

  

 

SCENE 2

(Garcin, alone)

 

(Garcin, alone. He goes to the bronze and touches it with his hand. He sits down. He gets back up again. He goes to the bell and presses it. It doesn't ring. He tries two or three times. But in vain. He goes to the door and tries to open it. It resists. He calls.)

 

Garcin

Valet! Valet!

 

(No response. He makes a rain of fists fall upon the door while calling the valet. Then he suddenly calms himself and goes back to sit down. At that moment the door opens and Ines enters, followed by the valet.)

 

SCENE 3

(Garcin, Ines, the valet)

 

Valet (to Garcin)

You called?

 

(Garcin makes to answer, but glances at Ines.)

 

Garcin

No.

 

Valet (turning to Ines)

Consider yourself at home, madam. (silence from Ines) If you have any questions... (Ines stays silent)

 

Valet (disappointed)

Normally clients like to inform themselves... I won't insist. Besides, as for the toothbrush, the bell and the Barbedienne bronze, sir is aware and he can answer you as well as I could.

 

(He leaves. Silence. Garcin avoids Ines with his gaze. Ines looks around her, then makes directly for Garcin.)

 

Ines

Where's Florence? (Silence from Garcin.) I asked you where Florence was.

 

Garcin

I've no idea.

 

Ines

Is that all you've found? Torture by absence? Well, you've screwed up. Florence was a little simpleton and I don't miss her.

 

Garcin

I'm sorry: who do think I am?

 

Ines

You? You're the executioner.

 

Garcin (suddenly surprised, and starts laughing)

What a hilarious mistake. The executioner, really? You came in, you saw me, and you thought:  that's the executioner. What an extravagance! That valet is ridiculous, he really should have introduced us. The executioner! I'm Joseph Garcin, publicist and man of letters. The truth is that we're in the same boat. Madam....?

 

Ines (dryly)

Ines Serrano. Mademoiselle.

 

Garcin

Very good. Perfect. Well, the ice is broken. And so you find my appearance to be that of an executioner? And how does one recognise an executioner, if you don't mind my asking?

 

Ines

They have the appearance of looking scared.

 

Garcin

Scared? That's too funny. And of whom? Of their victims?

 

Ines

Oh come on! I know what I'm saying. I've looked myself in the mirror.

 

Garcin

In the mirror? (looking around him) Incredible. They've taken everything remotely like a mirror. (pause) In any case, I can affirm that I'm not scared. I don't take the situation lightly and I'm very conscious of its seriousness. But I am not scared.

 

Ines (shrugging)

That's your affair. (pause) Do you occasionally go to to take a walk outside?

 

Garcin

The door's locked.

 

Ines

Never mind.

 

Garcin

I understand very well that my presence is importunate to you. And personally, I'd rather be alone: I've got to put my life in order and I need to collect myself. But I'm sure we can get along with one-another: I don't talk too much, I don't fidget, and I don't make noise. Only, if I can permit myself to advise you, we should observe extreme politeness between us. It'll be our best defense.

 

Ines

I'm not polite.

 

Garcin

I'll be polite for the both of us.

 

(Silence. Garcin is sat at the sofa. Ines walks the length and breadth.)

 

Ines (looking at him)

Your mouth.

 

Garcin (pulled from his reverie)

Does it please you?

 

Ines

Couldn't you stop your mouth? It's spinning like a top under your nose..

 

Garcin

I do beg your pardon. I wasn't aware.

 

Ines

That's what I'm reproaching you for. (Garcin tics) Again! You pretend politeness and you leave your face to abandon. You are not alone and you have no right to inflict the spectacle of your fear upon me.

 

(Garcin gets up and goes towards her)

 

Garcin

You're not scared, yourself?

 

Ines

To what end? Fear is useful before, when one still has hope.

 

Garcin (softly)

There is no more hope, but we are still before. We have yet to begin suffering, Madam.

Ines

I know. (pause) So? What's next?

 

Garcin

I don't know. I'm waiting.

 

(Silence. Garcin goes to sit down again. Ines resumes her walk. Gardin has a facial tic at the mouth, and, after looking to Ines, buries his face in his hands. Estelle and the valet enter.)
